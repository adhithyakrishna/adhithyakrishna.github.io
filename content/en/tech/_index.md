This section functions as a digital commonplace book, dedicated to the recent reading materials I've consumed. Since most of my reading happens in digital formats, these notes serve as a substitute for highlighting key passages in physical books. Essentially, they act as a memory aid, allowing you to quickly revisit and refresh my understanding of the content I've encountered.
