#### Civil War
___

___It was a blissful morning until I heard a blaring noise,
A noise of an explosion followed by shrill shouts and cries.
I saw a ginourmous object being dropped down from an hover,
Before I could react, everything was already over.___

___As I regained my bleared vision, I couldn't believe my eyes,
An enormous blanket of smog covered the scarlet sky.
Everything was tattered and demolished from the intense mar,
They had destroyed my entire village in the name of civil war.___

___You know,___

___Our ancestors inhabited this village and their origins cannot be dated,
Most ancient, revered and civilized that their sanctity cannot be stated.
The vast stretch of this fertile land is now wilted and withered,
My beautiful village that once flourished lies soulless and desimated.___

___The survivors were forced in to a refugee camp, a so-called safe place,
Thousands of us were coerced to survive in this constricted space.
In the name of displaced refugees, we were treated like an animal herd.
Our desperate cries for food and neccessities were ignored or left unheard.___

___My interim stay at this camp were the most unbearable days,
Each and every one of us suffered abuse in numerous ways.
Women and hapless infants were the most exploited victims,
These tortures was carried out to fulfill the dictator's dictums.___

___The horrendous act of inhumanity increased each day,
Rape and brutal abuse evolved into a cold-blooded slay.
Loosing my bloodmates one by one was something my heart couldn't bear,
All of them left this earth having their soul imprinted with fear.___

___As the seconds of darkness fleeted incessantly, arrived my final day.
I had not choice but to participate in this tragic play.
A pointy large bullet was fired, it pierced right in my heart,
I wish to leave back this final message as my soul starts to depart.___

```
Final message
-------------

"You were born on this earth bringing nothing,
And that is how you'll leave.
Your debauched ways of acquiring something,
Will definitely end up in grieve.

Everyone was born with an empty hand,
No person was alloted a permanent berth.
This entire Earth is mother nature's land,
And this is the eternal truth.

No force except the nature can,
determine your birth or death. 
Remember, Every soul killed here will revive again
like the beatified holy man of Nazareth."
```
-Adhi
