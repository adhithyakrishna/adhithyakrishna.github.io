Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
Example 1:
Input: &amp;ldquo;aacecaaa&amp;rdquo; Output: &amp;ldquo;aaacecaaa&amp;rdquo; Example 2:
Input: &amp;ldquo;abcd&amp;rdquo; Output: &amp;ldquo;dcbabcd&amp;rdquo;
Solution This problem utilises a part of the KMP algorithm. You can read more about the algorithm here, KMP algorithm.
Solving this problem involves a trick, we have to construct the LPS table.</description></item><item><title>Needle in Haystack KMP</title><link>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/coding-questions/needle-in-haystack-kmp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 11:55:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/coding-questions/needle-in-haystack-kmp/</guid><description>Problem statement Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Example 1:
Input: haystack = &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo;, needle = &amp;ldquo;ll&amp;rdquo; Output: 2 Example 2:
Input: haystack = &amp;ldquo;aaaaa&amp;rdquo;, needle = &amp;ldquo;bba&amp;rdquo; Output: -1 Clarification:
Return 0 when needle is an empty string.
Constraints:
haystack and needle consist only of lowercase English characters.
Solution Please refer to the KMP article KMP algorithm to learn about the KMP algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Internet protocol version 4 validation</title><link>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/coding-questions/ipv4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 05:53:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/coding-questions/ipv4/</guid><description>About the test I recently took an OA. It was a 75 minutes exam consisting of three questions. The test was conducted on codility platform. This OA was different from others in that, we should scan the input from the scanner class and output should be printed using System.out.println() according to the output format provided. While the remaining 2 problems were doable, one problem stood out, it was a simple one line statement.</description></item></channel></rss>
