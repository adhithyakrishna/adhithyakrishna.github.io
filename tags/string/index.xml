Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
Example 1:
Input: &amp;ldquo;aacecaaa&amp;rdquo; Output: &amp;ldquo;aaacecaaa&amp;rdquo; Example 2:
Input: &amp;ldquo;abcd&amp;rdquo; Output: &amp;ldquo;dcbabcd&amp;rdquo;
Solution This problem utilises a part of the KMP algorithm. You can read more about the algorithm here, KMP algorithm.
Solving this problem involves a trick, we have to construct the LPS table.</description></item><item><title>Needle in Haystack KMP</title><link>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/coding-questions/needle-in-haystack-kmp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 11:55:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/coding-questions/needle-in-haystack-kmp/</guid><description>Problem statement Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Example 1:
Input: haystack = &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo;, needle = &amp;ldquo;ll&amp;rdquo; Output: 2 Example 2:
Input: haystack = &amp;ldquo;aaaaa&amp;rdquo;, needle = &amp;ldquo;bba&amp;rdquo; Output: -1 Clarification:
Return 0 when needle is an empty string.
Constraints:
haystack and needle consist only of lowercase English characters.
Solution Please refer to the KMP article KMP algorithm to learn about the KMP algorithm.</description></item><item><title>KMP Pattern Matching Algorithm</title><link>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/important-algorithms/kmp-pattern-matching/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 09:24:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/important-algorithms/kmp-pattern-matching/</guid><description>KMP Algorithm I recently came across this awesome algorithm to locate a substring within a string. Let us consider a string s (small string) that has to be located in a large string l. A brute force approach would something like traverse the the larger list l until the start is matched with the small string s, and then use two pointers to traverse both the string. While this may seem like a good approach, consider a scenario where the length of s is 100 characters, 99 characters in the string l matches s but the last character doesn&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item></channel></rss>
