It was a 75 minutes exam consisting of three questions. The test was conducted on codility platform. This OA was different from others in that, we should scan the input from the scanner class and output should be printed using System.out.println() according to the output format provided. While the remaining 2 problems were doable, one problem stood out, it was a simple one line statement.</description></item></channel></rss>
