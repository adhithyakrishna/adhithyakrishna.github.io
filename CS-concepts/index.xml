Extending a thread class Implementing a Runnable interface It is recommended to use runnable interfaces because, class can extend only a single class because of the Java&amp;rsquo;s lack of support to multiple inheritence, but a class can implement multiple interfaces.
Threads can also be created using anonymous classes like below
Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5; i++) { System.</description></item><item><title>Recursion I</title><link>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/cs-concepts/recursion_i/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 19:37:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://adhithyakrishna.github.io/cs-concepts/recursion_i/</guid><description>Recursion is bascially a function calling itself. Recursion has to be implemented carefully, otherwise the function might run indefinitely causing the program to crash.
There are two important properties to recursion,
1) Base case - a terminating scenario, which does not use recursion to produce answer.
2) Recurrence relation - reduces other cases towards the base case.
The difficulty of recursion problems solved in this articles are going to be in the increasing order.</description></item></channel></rss>
